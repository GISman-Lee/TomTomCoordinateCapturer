This tool is used to fast capture coordinates with map clicking, and it is with fast copy and paste functions.

How to use:

After installing and opening the plugin, you just need to click on a location on the map canvas, then you will get the coordinates in WGS84. You could either use "Clip to ClipBoard" button or "Ctrl + C" to copy the coordinates then use.
